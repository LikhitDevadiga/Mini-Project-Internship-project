                           |---->john.png         (this is that particular students face)
Do it for all students of the class

Step5: Open the file path in command prompt(ex D:\downloads\Attendance>python app.py) and press enter.(Make sure to install all the necessary libraries to run the file)
Step6: Once the flask local server is created copy the link and open it in browser.
Step5: Upload a class picture (Note: Every face should be clearly visible in the image, high clarity image is prefered)

(Important note- Adjust the tolerence as needed in the app.py file for more or less strictness in detecting faces)
